This project is made using Carto and High-charts to generate visuals that show data about students from Qatar studying abroad through grants. The data was published by the Ministry of Development, Planning and Statistics as the Education Report in 2015.
##Project Procedure:
CSV files were created to tell 2 stories from the data set.
1. The vast number of students from Qatar studying abroad on grants.
2. Trend in what students choose to study.

The website was made using a template from ghPages, and the visualisations were embedded in the index.html file.
